You are a network administrator tasked with diagnosing a network issue. During your analysis, you come across the following situations involving various network components and tasks. Your task is to identify the OSI layer primarily responsible for each situation.\nSituation 1: A user reports that they are unable to access a website using its domain name, but they can access it using the IP address directly.\nSituation 2: A network switch is managing the flow of data between devices on the same local network but is failing to direct the traffic correctly.\nSituation 3: A large file transfer between two servers on different networks fails halfway through. You suspect an issue with how the data is being segmented and reassembled.\n[4] CO1\n4. A digital communication system transmits the following bit sequence at a data rate of 1 Mbps: 110101011001011.
